# Style guide

Other than the rules defined here, please follow the
[Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).

- **Sentence case:**
  Use American English style for general capitalization.
  Use sentence case in all headings, titles, and navigation.
  This includes for user-facing copy and within code and documentation.
  [This is consistent with the Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting).

- **Full sentences:**
  Use full sentences, ending with proper punctuation.
  This applies to both copy and to code comments and logs.
  It also applies within bulleted and numbered lists.

- **Ordering:**
  - Order members in code by **read-create-update-delete** where possible.
  - Order lists alphabetically when there is no other natural order.
    This applies to both copy and to code (such as parameter/method lists and documentation).

- **Plurality:**
  For naming, singular forms should be preferred over plural forms where possible.
  This includes for folder, package, and feature names.
  REST paths should be plural, due to convention.

- **Product terminology:**
  The words _Feature_, _Server_, and _Application_
  should be capitalized when they refer to the Limber-specific definitions of those terms.
  _Feature_ should not be capitalized when it refers to [organization features](/feature/organization/README.md).

- **Not null:**
  Prefer the term "not null" to "non-null".
